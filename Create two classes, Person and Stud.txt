Create two classes, Person and Student, where Student inherits from Person.

The Person class should have the following attributes:

name (string)
age (integer)
The Student class should add an additional attribute:

studentID (integer)
Implement parameterized constructors for both classes to initialize their attributes.

Create objects for both the Person and Student classes and display their details.

Use single inheritance, where the Student class inherits the attributes and methods of the Person class.

Write the classes and a main() function to demonstrate the inheritance relationship and display the details of both the Person and Student objects.

Feel free to include any necessary header files and use the cout statement for output.
